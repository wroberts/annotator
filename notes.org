*** DONE allow multiple annotations of the same sentence
    Idea: add another column to the annotations table which will form
    another part of the "primary key", along with the clause_id and user_id.

    tasks:
    - [X] add to Annotation model
    - [X] add to CSV export (commands.py)
    - [X] add to REST
    - [X] add to angular component
    - [X] add to interface
    - [X] modify existing tests to pass
    - [X] add new tests for new functionality

    questions:
    - [X] how does the interface address the multiple annotations?
      right now, we just ask for a clause, which includes a single
      annotation (optional)

      it seems likely that the REST should return an array of
      annotation objects instead of just a single object
    - [X] how does the interface save multiple annotations?

      right now, we PUT a single annotation to the URL that represents
      a clause

      it seems like we should manage this, so that if we PUT an
      annotation with a new annotation_idx, the backend will do the
      right thing with this
